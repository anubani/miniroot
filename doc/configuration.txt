All paths are relative to the main directory containing the Makefile.

The variables XXX_SRC can be a version number, a local tarball, a tarball URL
or a VCS URL (remote or local). Git URLs can include a branch as an option.

toolchain
---------

If not defined, miniroot uses the default toolchain of the host.

To use a different toolchain, the path must be specified with
	TOOLCHAIN_PATH
If toolchain binaries have a prefix, it must be defined in
	TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX
In order to use a wrapper with the compiler (like ccache), you can define
	TARGET_CC

Linux can be built with a different toolchain than the one used for the rootfs.
All the toolchain variables can be prefixed by LINUX_ to specify this second toolchain.

build options
-------------

Options for the toolchain can be set via the following variables.
preprocessor:
	TARGET_CPPFLAGS
C compiler:
	TARGET_CFLAGS
C++ compiler:
	TARGET_CXXFLAGS
linker:
	TARGET_LDFLAGS
Default values are set in Makefile.

linux
-----

Linux will be built if requested by a target of type linux_image.

The source can be chosen via
	LINUX_SRC

The configuration can be retrieved from
	LINUX_CONFIG
It can be the name of a default configuration in the sources or another file.
It can be configured by
	make linux_menuconfig
A rootfs will be embedded if initramfs is selected in the Linux configuration.

busybox
-------

The source can be chosen via
	BUSYBOX_SRC

There is a default configuration in
	busybox/default_config
A specific configuration can be retrieved from
	BUSYBOX_CONFIG
It can be configured by
	make linux_menuconfig


packages
--------

All packages are disabled by default. They can be enabled by setting
	PKG_XXX = yes
Source is retrieved in
	XXX_SRC
Other variables can be overridden.
Default values are defined in the headers of each package in
	packages/XXX/XXX.mk

main target
-----------

When typing "make" without specifying a target, all the targets defined in
	TARGETS
will be built. It defines the goal of the project.
