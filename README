Read config-default.mk
and
Write your own config.mk (as config-example.mk).

'-------'

miniroot is intended to be a simple solution to build and/or develop a
minimal system based on Linux and BusyBox.

The system is "makefile-oriented" with few shell scripts. Its goal is
to be comprehensive by a human...

.-------------------.
| WHAT does it do ? |
'-------------------'

The kernel automatically embed the root filesystem into an initramfs.
But it can also build an external compressed root.

Linux and BusyBox build systems can be directly accessed with the
wildcard rules linux_* and busybox_* (e.g. linux_menuconfig).

The libraries can be built with the minimal set of needed functions.

The configurations and other customizations can be archived in a
separate directory by making config.mk a link (e.g. to config/config.mk).

The build system can be extended with a makefile defined as EXTRA_RULES.
