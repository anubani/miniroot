| HOW to start ? |
'----------------'

git clone git://github.com/tmonjalo/miniroot.git
and
Write your own config.mk (see doc/ directory).

Customizations are done by setting variables in config.mk.
The list of relevant variables can be found in headers of .mk files or
in the main Makefile.

.-------.
| WHY ? |
'-------'

miniroot is intended to be a simple solution to build and/or develop a
minimal system based on Linux and BusyBox.

The system is "makefile-oriented" with few shell scripts. Its main goal is
to be human readable.

.-------------------.
| WHAT does it do ? |
'-------------------'

The kernel automatically embed the root filesystem into an initramfs if
selected in the Linux configuration.
A rootfs image can also be built separately.

Linux and BusyBox build systems can be directly accessed with the
wildcard rules linux_* and busybox_* (e.g. linux_menuconfig).

The libraries can be built with the minimal set of needed functions.
WARNING: mklibs.py probably needs bug fixes.
Use "TARGET_LDFLAGS = -static" to forbid dynamic libraries.

The configurations and other customizations can be archived in a
separate directory by making config.mk a link (e.g. to config/config.mk).

The build system can be extended via a makefile defined as EXTRA_RULES.

Packages are downloaded at the first build. They can be a local directory,
a tarball, or a VCS repository. Example:
	LINUX_SRC = git://linux-arm.org/linux-2.6.git wonderful-branch
